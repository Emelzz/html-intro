          <h2>Code Crusade: Byte by Byte</h2>
          <p>
            Towards the end of NYSC, I was uncertain about my next step. Most of
            my friends were in tech, so they encouraged me to try web
            development. Honestly, I was skeptical, I had never been into
            complex computer tasks beyond basic Word and Excel. But I gave it a
            shot.

            It was tough. Learning HTML and CSS took me three months, and I
            often wondered if I was wasting time. Eventually, I put web
            development aside to pursue my passion for agriculture and other job
            opportunities. Two and a half years later, I had hit dead ends in
            both. Age restrictions shut me out of many entry-level roles, and
            depression followed. That’s when I decided to return to web
            development. It still wasn’t easy, but I kept going, thanks in part
            to encouragement from developer friends.

            Last month, one told me about the
            <a href="https://www.genesystechhub.com/"
              >Genesys Upskill Programme</a
            >, and now, I’m building a simple web page as part of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Am I still facing challenges? Definitely. But I’m determined to stay
            on track and hopefully grow to love this field and not just as a way
            out, but as a way forward.
